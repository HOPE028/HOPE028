Hey! I'm a highly technical founder and engineer with a critical focus on product design, functionality, simplicity, and reliability. Also, I am an experienced team leader having built OutreachGenius from 0 to 10 employees with a strong focus on culture, accountability, and speed. 

I believe in taking the unconventional path to achieve uncommon success. That is why I have never let anything keep me from going after my goals, regardless of how scary or unprepared I feel - because real learning comes from doing.
